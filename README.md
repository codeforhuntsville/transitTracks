Our Open source prototype project is now on Heroku: [Hop Around Huntsville](http://HopAroundHuntsville.com)

This open source project of [Code for the South](http://www.CodeForHuntsville.org) is looking for project team members.

# Development

The project uses a slightly modified ES5 style guide based on [Airbnb's ESLint 'legacy' standard](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb).

`eslint` can be executed using `npm run lint`.

# Deployment

The project can be executed using `npm start`.
